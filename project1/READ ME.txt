Plan:

For this project we have to make it possible to simplify black scholes processes
by desactivating some time dependent variables to gain computation speed.

We create constantblacksholesprocess a copy of blackscholesprocess that will handle the simplified operation.
In constantblacksholesprocess We modify dividendTS riskRate and the functions drift by replacing fowardRate by zeroRate.
We also disable the update of localVolatility().

We also modify mceuropeanengine by adding a boolean wich allow the user to choose between the two processes and rewrite je pathgeneration.
we add an if/else statement following this boolean wich will create differents pathgenerator.


Question:
